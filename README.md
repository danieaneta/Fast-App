# Fast-App-Quick AI Functionality
 
This is a repo dedictated to posting and exploring ways to create fast AI functionality using external or custom models. Each of these functionalities can be added onto existing applications or built into it's own application. 

All requirements are listed within the requirements.txt file located within the specific functionality folder as well as the dependencies. The requirements can be installed into a venv or on your local Python. For some functionalities, you may need PyTorch and Cuda Toolkit installed. 

Prerequisites for CUDA powered applications/functionality:
<ul>
 <li>Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 (install Visual Studio + the C++ Development Tools/Modules)</li>
 <li>Cuda Toolkit 11.7 or 11.8 </li>
 <li>PyTorch for Cuda 11.7 or 11.8</li>
</ul>
